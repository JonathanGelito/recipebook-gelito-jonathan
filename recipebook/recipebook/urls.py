# I have not discussed the Python language code in my program 
# with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants 
# assigned to this course.

# I have not used Python language code obtained from another student, 
# or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.

# If any Python language code or documentation used in my program 
# was obtained from another source, such as a textbook or website, 
# that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in the comments 
# of my program.
